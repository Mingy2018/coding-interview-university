## Issues

**Impostor Syndrome(冒名顶替症)**

> A psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments.

For Programming: coding involves regular **failure**. -> I'm a FRAUD ?



1.People with imposter syndrome **hold themselves back:**

- Do not **share knowledge**
- Do not **collaborate**
- Do not **help with OSS**
- Do not **apply for jobs**

You shouldn't feel like you have to slay a dragon to get a job.

2.People with imposter syndrome **push themselves too hard**:

Burnout: lose interest to code and work -> GAME OVER !
